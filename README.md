##  E-commerce Back End Module 13


# Description 

This project is a Back-End E-commerce Application designed to manage product data, categories, and tags using Express.js, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on various data entities such as: Categories, Products, and Tags. This application efficiently handles database interactions and provides structured API endpoints that can be tested using Insomnia or Postman.
